# Safe_Snort_Alerts-v1
These scripts help you generate Snort alerts to verify whether your Snort service is functioning correctly.

# Usage:
**Run Powershell as Administrator**

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

```
.\<script-name>.ps1
```

# Note:
* Tested on FlareVM. You can install or use it on any Windows system—your choice.
* After running the first command, you'll see a warning message. While it may look intimidating, it's required to run the script. From a security perspective, it is recommended to type "Y" — this change only applies to the next command, not the entire PowerShell session.

You're all set!
